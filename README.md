## Introduction
SpendWise is a web-based expense tracker designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. The platform offers secure user registration and login, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete transactions. With SpendWise, users can generate detailed reports to analyze their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions. The project is built using Django, and it incorporates responsive design, real-time notifications, and secure access control to enhance user experience and data security.

## Agile
Given the timeframe of this project I prioritised delivering a minimum viable product by the deadline, with ideas on what could be added if time allowed. This process was managed with a kanban board that assigned tasks with either must have or should have labels.

## Wireframes
The wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq Wireframes to map out the structure of the site on mobile, Tablet and desktop view. Doing so helped to guide the development of the site and how the quiz interface would best suit the user.
