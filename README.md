### Wireframes
![Homepage Wireframe across various devices](https://github.com/Navya-K-N-24/SpendWise/blob/fffc237c72fb0b3131fc0ec2bc60be79395bc355/Wireframe%20Homepage.png)
- The wireframes were created using Balsamiq Wireframes to map out the structure of the site on mobile, tablet, and desktop views. This guided the development of the site and ensured that the interface suited users on various devices.

### Design Rationale
  - The layout is clean and minimalistic to make navigation intuitive for all users.
  - The color scheme ensures adequate contrast for readability, addressing accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
  - Typography choices prioritize readability across devices and assistive technologies.

### Reasoning For Any Final Changes
  - Changes were made to improve usability, such as adjusting button sizes for mobile devices and ensuring keyboard accessibility across all interactive elements.

## Key Features

### Feature 1: User Registration and Login 
  - Users can register with a secure password and log in to access their personalized dashboard.
  - **Inclusivity Notes:** 
    - The registration and login forms are designed to be accessible for keyboard navigation.
    - Field labels are clear and include descriptive error messages to assist users with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.

## Deployment
### Platform: Heroku
### High-Level Deployment Steps 
  1. Code was pushed to the GitHub repository linked with Heroku.
  2. A Procfile was created to specify the WSGI server (gunicorn).
  3. Environment variables for sensitive data, such as the database URL, were configured in Heroku.

### Verification and Validation
  - The deployed application was tested to ensure it matched the local development version in functionality.
  - Accessibility checks were performed using browser developer tools to verify keyboard navigation and color contrast compliance.

### Security Measures
  - Environment variables were used to store sensitive data, such as the database URL.
  - DEBUG mode was disabled in production to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Code Generation
  - Strategic use of AI accelerated prototyping and coding processes. 
  - Examples: Prompts were used to generate alternative solutions for form validations.

### Debugging
  - AI tools resolved syntax errors and optimized logic, making the codebase easier to maintain.

### Performance and UX Optimization
  - Improvements included faster page load times and enhanced user experience through AI-recommended layout adjustments.

### Automated Unit Testing
  - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

### Overall Impact
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.
