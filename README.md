## Deployment
### Platform: Heroku
The web app is hosted on Heroku using Eco Dynos, and is deployed via the designated Github repository.

A request is made via the CI Database Maker, which generates a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS, with the database credentials sent to the email address provided in the request.

### High-Level Deployment Steps 

The [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template) was used to create the GitHub repository, so that the website could be developed in the correct setup of Gitpod IDE.

The GitHub Copilot extension was also installed in my local client version of MS VS Code, which was also connected with the same GitHub repository and linked to Gitpod via SSH. This allows for AI pair programming in the initial stages of development to create certain sections faster.

The deployment process is as follows:
1. Login to your GitHub profile and go to [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). **Use this template** and **Create a new repository**.
2. Open the Code Institute Gitpod IDE workspace. Open Gitpod workspace. Create the MVP.
3. Login to Heroku and create a new app using a unique name and select the correct region. Add Config Vars in Settings.
4. Install web server gunicorn and freeze requirements.
5. Create a new Procfile in the root directory and specify the running of the web app with process type as gunicorn in the Procfile.
6. Environment variables for sensitive data, such as the database URL, were configured in Heroku.
7. Add deployed apps to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py, and set Debug = False. Add, commit and push to the Github repo.
8. In Heroku, go to Deploy tab, search for the correct Github repo and under manual deploy click **Deploy Branch**.
9. **View app** to verify that it is been deployed correctly. This deployed site can now be validated and tested e.g. in Chrome Dev Tools.
10. In the app's Resources tab, check that Eco Dynos are used and remove any unnecessary Add-ons.
11. Subsequent changes to the code will need to be pushed to the Github repo and manually deployed on Heroku.

### Verification and Validation
  - The deployed application was tested to ensure it matched the local development version in functionality.
  - Accessibility checks were performed using browser developer tools for color contrast compliance.

### Security Measures
  - Environment variables were used to store sensitive data, such as the database URL.
  - DEBUG mode was disabled in production to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

## Device Responsivness across Devices
- SpendWise is designed to be fully responsive across all device sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience whether accessed on mobile, tablet, or desktop. The design follows a mobile-first approach, based on the hypothesis that the majority of users maange expenses on their smartphones.

- To achieve this, the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using a combination of Bootstrap's grid system and Flexbox, applied strategically to maintain consistency and usability across devices.

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

Throughout this project, I relied on GitHub Copilot to streamline development and testing. This was my first time using AI tools so extensively, and it became an invaluable collaborator during the process.

- **Code Creation:** 
  - Reflection: Initially, I was hesitant about how much I could rely on Copilot, but I quickly saw its value in generating boilerplate code, like Django models and CRUD views. Using reverse and multi-step prompts gave me the confidence to explore alternative approaches, and it even taught me new techniques I hadn’t considered before. For instance, it suggested cleaner, more Pythonic ways to handle database queries that saved me time and effort.
  - Highlight: The iterative back-and-forth with Copilot felt like having a knowledgeable pair programmer by my side. This collaboration made me more thoughtful about how I structured my prompts, as clearer questions led to better answers.

- **Debugging:** 
  - Reflection: Debugging with Copilot was a learning experience in itself. It didn’t just find errors; it often suggested solutions that highlighted gaps in my understanding. I appreciated how it encouraged me to simplify complex logic, making the code easier to maintain and more accessible to anyone who might work on it in the future.

- **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
  - Reflection: One of my proudest moments came when I used Copilot to refine the Bootstrap styling. I wasn’t very confident in front-end design, but the AI helped bridge that gap. It suggested small, impactful changes, like improving button alignment and tweaking breakpoints, that made the application feel polished and professional. These adjustments also ensured that the app was truly responsive, which was a priority for me.

- **Automated Unit Testing:**
  - Reflection: Writing unit tests has always been a challenging aspect of development for me, but Copilot turned it into a manageable task. I used question-and-answer and multi-step prompts to generate a solid starting point for my test cases, which I could then refine to align with the project’s requirements. Seeing it anticipate edge cases—like invalid user input—made me more aware of the importance of writing comprehensive tests. This process deepened my understanding of Django’s testing framework and made me more confident in my ability to create robust applications.

### Overall Impact
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.
